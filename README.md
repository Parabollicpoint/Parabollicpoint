- 👋 Hi, I’m @Parabollicpoint
- 👀 I’m interested in ... learning things I dont know and things I didnt know I dont know. Mainly apllied math and science but as GitHub
- is involved I interested in learning the basics of programming lamguage syntax and the shells
- that will be universal im tomorrows universal app or device or database, whatever it is.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... the blind spots in my character.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... transparency handshakes and validation.
- 📫 You probably know more ways to reach me than I do. i understand if you can or will not acknowledge
- them all. Regardless I am genuinely impressed and admire your skills and collaboration. I assume these things
cant be acknowledged and understand if I am classified as a red teamer and looked down upon. I am not all red and hope
some may see that.
